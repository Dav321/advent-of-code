# Advent of Code
My solutions for [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025), implemented in Rust.

## Running the solutions
Make sure you have the required input files in the project root:
```
input.txt   # your personal puzzle input
test.txt    # example input from the problem statement
```

Modify the import in ```src/y25/y25.rs``` to represent the day you wish to solve.

Run using input.txt:
```bash
cargo run
```

Run using test.txt:
```bash
cargo test
```
